# Classic Snake Game 

This Snake Game is my first step into game development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to control a snake, collect food, and grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and itself. The game features smooth movement, a dynamic score system, and increasing difficulty as the snake grows. I used JavaScript event listeners for controls, CSS for styling, and HTML canvas for rendering. This project helped me understand game loops, collision detection, and logic implementation. Itâ€™s a fun, interactive challenge, and Iâ€™d love feedback to improve it further. Try it out and enjoy!
